        <h1>Workflow and service examples</h1>
        <p>This site contains examples of how back end cheminformatics services 
            can be tied into workflows. Currently we have 2 simple demos:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A set of <a href="file-based-examples.html">File based demos</a> (plus a 
                <a href="descriptions.html">description</a> of how these are implemented.</li>
            <li>A "work in progress" set of <a href="drag-and-drop-examples.html">drag-and-drop examples</a> 
                (note that the workflow building part is not yet functional). In these 
                examples structure files are uploaded to the server and stored there
                so that once uploaded all processing takes place on the server. These 
                examples used ChemAxon's Marvin and JChem, Chemistry Development Kit
                and RDKit.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: these examples are provided to indicate the possibilities
            of what you can do with our technology. They are not expected to be used for 
            real work, and if you do want to implement things using these approaches 
            your will need the necessary licenses for the underlying technology. For
            more information contact us info(at)informaticsmatters(dot)com.</p>

        <p>WARNING: when trying out these examples examples you should use relatively 
            small input files as file uploads are involved and the server on which 
            it is running is very small. Please limit the files to hundreds or at most 
            a few thousand molecules.<br>
            SDF or smiles formats should be OK. Results are returned in SDF format.</p>
